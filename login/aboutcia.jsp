<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Certificate Issuing Authority(CIA) is a centralised 
 	     certificate  management system which stores and manages the certificates of various 
 	     government and non-government institutions all over India. It aims at building 
          a friendly interface for the the verification and retrieval of certificates.<br>
  </p><p>
          It allows various certificate issuing organisations to register themselves and 
          subsequently upload certificates issued to candidates.The 
          CIA keeps track of the organisations registered with it. Any information 
          available with the CIA can be viewed by performing candidate based or organisation based 
          searches. The certificates, too can be viewed. </font></p>
